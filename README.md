# New hire policy:

* Team members need to maintain core hours, and teams need work schedules that overlap predictably to work together effectively.

* We expect our team members to work amicably with each other. Of each member, we expect cooperation, collaboration, contribution, communication, and initiative. We expect each to contribute to making the team a safe place to ask questions with a minimum of judgment and unhealthy competition.

* We expect our new programmer to make decisions. We expect our programmers to communicate decisions as they're being made.

* Programmers who telecomute must be as avaliable as their teammates just down the hall(perhaps more so!). We expect them to let their teammates, colleagues, and manager know where and how to reach them and to repeatedly encourage them to do so.

* We expect interaction and engagement in our staff meetings.
